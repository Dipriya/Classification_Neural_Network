Reuters News Classification with Keras
This code demonstrates how to build a text classification model using Keras to classify news articles from the Reuters dataset. The model is trained to predict the category of a news article based on its textual content.

Requirements
The code requires the following libraries to be installed:

NumPy
Keras
You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install numpy
pip install keras


Data Preparation
The Reuters dataset is used for training and testing the model. The dataset is automatically downloaded and preprocessed by Keras. It consists of short news articles from the Reuters newswire, categorized into different topics.

Model Architecture
The model is a sequential neural network with dense layers. It uses the Dense layer with a relu activation function for feature extraction. Dropout regularization is applied to prevent overfitting. The final layer uses the softmax activation function to predict the probability distribution over the different classes.

Training
The model is trained using the fit function in Keras. The training data is split into batches, and the model is trained for a specified number of epochs. The loss function used is categorical_crossentropy, and the adam optimizer is used to minimize the loss. The model's accuracy is also computed during training.

Vectorizing the Data
The text data is transformed into a binary matrix representation using the Tokenizer class in Keras. The Tokenizer converts the text into sequences and then converts the sequences into a binary matrix where each row represents a document, and each column represents a word in the vocabulary.

Results
The model's performance on the training and test sets is printed after training. The accuracy metric is used to evaluate the model's performance.
